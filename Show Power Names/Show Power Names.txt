Keep power names always displayed or toggled on

Mod files:
powersmenu.swf
powersmenu_lrg.swf

Test getting the first power:
player.addspell 2BACBA
player.addperk 25E19C


PowersMenu ------

✔private var NamesVisible:Boolean = true;
- this is inverted with the show names button
- needs to start out true because we want to show them by default
- won't actually show the names

* this is what we want. The first press of the toggle names key also hides them as expected

----
Can still see the power name when clicking on it though, so try to fix that
----

Power
setData
- ✔add check to see if selector is visible before showing name
if (!bSelectorShouldBeVisible)
{
    this.bPowerNameShouldBeVisible = true;
    this.PowerName_mc.visible = true;
}

--- GREAT SUCCESS ---
