EXPANDED POWER MENU
-----

This mod enables players to select additional modded powers in addition to the vanilla Starborn powers
Spells must be added to the player by some means before they will show in the new list (via player.addspell, a quest, perks, scripting, or other means)

Features:
- Adds an additional list in the Powers menu to select modded powers
- Shows Starborn and modded power names (if they have one) with rank by default
- Adds the favorite slot in brackets after Starborn and modded Power names
- The Powers menu is accessible if the player has at least one modded power or Starborn power

For mod authors, this mod is meant to be a dependency to enable players to select modded powers. Please see the Mod Author article for more details

Coming Soon:
Icons for modded powers should be shown above the power info section (far right) like Starborn powers. Custom icons currently show on the favorites menu but not above the info area.

-----
EXAMPLE FILES
-----
Two optional files serve as an example to add your own modded powers. If you are an experienced modder, you may not need these, but see the Mod Author article for more details:

- ExampleAbilities.esm includes a large amount of spell records to demonstrate the mod and the new list. These powers are not meant to be used in gameplay. You will need to player.addspell to see these abilities

- powerslibrary.swf includes icons used by ExampleAbilities.esm from the game that can be used with Keywords to show a custom icon on the favorites menu. See the Mod Author article for more details.
