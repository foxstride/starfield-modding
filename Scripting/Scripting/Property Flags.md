#### Auto
Auto defines getter/setter

#### AutoReadOnly
Same as Auto, but read only

#### Const
Pulls reference from game files
If not using Const, a save game will have whatever definition when that was added to the game, meaning if the definition changes later, it will not update

#### Mandatory
In CK, gives reminders if the properties are not assigned
