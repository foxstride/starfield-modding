Each Tab Category has scale W 234.300 H 40.250
234.300 * 5 = 1171.5
If dividing by 6, we then get W 195.25

Change the object at Depth 1 to W 195.25
This should also change it for the second frame when it's selected too

The corresponding text elements should also be changed to W 195.25 H 18.799 (scale proportionally)
The font size for both text elements should be increased from 18 to 20

For LRG, we have W 313 * 5 = 1565
1565 / 6 = 260.85
