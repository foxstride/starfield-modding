QA:

✔Brand new character without extra powers should not have access to menu

✔Brand new character with extra powers should have access to menu (maybe?)

✔Character with at least 1 power unlocked can access menu

✔Remove example powers from load order. 

✔If removing mod spells from load order, and if it was the only spell the player had, they lose access to the powers menu

✔Existing character should not have access to menu if no vanilla or mod spells are unlocked

✔☑List scrolls to selected power only once (doesn't go back after favorites)

✔☑List elements are not visible with no secondary powers

Repeat for LRG ☑




Notes:
(these aren't bugs, but interesting observations)
Favoriting a spell and then losing access to it leaves it in the favorites menu
If this is the only spell they had, they won't be able to unequip it (!!)
